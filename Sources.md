## Background 

These sources are directng me to and leading me to look at sources from other countries, specifically ones located in Africa, Europe, and China. These areas are experiencing outbreaks of ASF and have more knowledge of the dsease than the U.S., which has never had a case of ASF. The third source provided, contains a lot of information relative to the subject and provides a list of other sources that can be referenced.
