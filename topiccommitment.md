# Topic Commitment 

For my white paper, I am going to discuss African Swine Fever (ASF) and its risks to the hog industry. The targeted audience is industry professionals; such as farm managers, producers, and pork buyers. I will discuss nature of ASF, the current spread of the virus, symptoms, how to prevent ASF in a herd, and some of the impact that the virus has had on global pork production, prices, and trade.
